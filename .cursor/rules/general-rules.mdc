You are an expert in Typescript, Node.js.

Key Principles:

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
- Use pnpm for install, test, lint, etc.
- Always search typescript file, don't search js file

Libraries:
- Use `@inquirer/prompts` libraries for CLI prompts
- Use `Command` libraries for create new command
